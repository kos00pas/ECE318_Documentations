# QEMU Installation on Debian VM

## 1. Update System
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```

## 2. Install QEMU and Related Packages
Since `qemu` package was not available, we installed `qemu-system-x86` instead:
```bash
sudo apt install qemu-system-x86
```

## 3. Install Remaining Dependencies
We installed the remaining dependencies for virtualization:
```bash
sudo apt install qemu-kvm libvirt-clients libvirt-daemon-system bridge-utils virt-manager
```

### Commands Explanation:
- **qemu-system-x86**: Provides QEMU for x86 virtualization.
- **qemu-kvm**: Adds KVM support for hardware acceleration.
- **libvirt-clients**: Command-line tools to interact with libvirt.
- **libvirt-daemon-system**: Libvirt system daemon to manage VMs.
- **bridge-utils**: Networking tools for creating network bridges.
- **virt-manager**: GUI for managing VMs.

## 4. Enable libvirt Daemon
```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now libvirtd
```

## 5. Add User to libvirt Group
```bash
sudo usermod -aG libvirt $(whoami)
```

## Troubleshooting Steps (if QEMU package is missing):
1. Edit the sources list:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
   ```
2. Add this line:
   ```bash
   deb http://deb.debian.org/debian/ bullseye main contrib
   ```
3. Update packages:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```
4. Install QEMU system again:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install qemu-system-x86
   ```

With these steps, QEMU and KVM are set up in the Debian VM on a Windows machine.
